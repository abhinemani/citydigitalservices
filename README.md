City Digital Services [prototype]
=============

This is a prototype application to link together various digital services/tools in a city and present them in a streamlined, common, mobile friendly format, city-to-city. This is meant to showcase the value of using linked components for local government digital service delivery, and visualize how cities compare to each other.

This relies on Tabletop, Sheetsee, and Google Fusion tables, making it simple and easy to add a new city to the map and create a unified digital presense. See instructions on adding your city for visualization / prototyping purposes on the demo site: abhinemani.com/citydigitalservices

Note: this is a prototype, not meant to be a fully deployed application.
